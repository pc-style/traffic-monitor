```jsx

```
import {Block, Button, Text, theme as primer} from '@primer/components'
import {ThemeProvider} from 'emotion-theming'

// a theme with custom spacing and font sizes
const theme = {
...primer,
space: [0, 8, 16, 32, 64],
fontSizes: [10, 12, 16, 24, 48],
}

// override
theme.colors.bodytext = '#111'

export default () => (
<ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
<Block sx={{color: 'bodytext', p: 4}}>
<Text fontSize={4}>Hello, world!</Text>
</Block>
</ThemeProvider>
)
```

```

```
import React from 'react'
import {AriaStatus} from '@primer/react'

function ExampleComponent() {
const [loading, setLoading] = React.useState(true)
return (
<dialog ref={ref}>
<h1>Example content</h1>
{loading ? <AriaStatus>Loading example dialog</AriaStatus> : <DialogContent />}
</dialog>
)
}
```

```

## Basic HTML Div Structure with Nested Children in JSX

This snippet shows a fundamental example of how HTML elements, when used in JSX, accept content as children. A `div` element contains two nested `div` elements, demonstrating the common pattern of defining content structure directly within the parent's tags. This is a core concept for structuring UI in React.

**Source:** [https://github.com/primer/react/blob/main/contributor-docs/component-contents-api-patterns.md#_snippet_2](https://github.com/primer/react/blob/main/contributor-docs/component-contents-api-patterns.md#_snippet_2)

```jsx

```
<div>
<div>Some content</div>
<div>More content</div>
</div>
```

```

primer-react/
â”œâ”€ docs/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ content/
â”‚  â”‚  â”œâ”€ Component.mdx
```

```

---

## Basic HTML Unordered List with List Items in JSX

This snippet provides another example of HTML elements accepting children, specifically an unordered list (`ul`) containing list items (`li`). It highlights how standard HTML structures are represented in JSX, where the `li` elements are direct children of the `ul` element, adhering to typical web content structuring.

**Source:** [https://github.com/primer/react/blob/main/contributor-docs/component-contents-api-patterns.md#_snippet_3](https://github.com/primer/react/blob/main/contributor-docs/component-contents-api-patterns.md#_snippet_3)

```jsx

```
<ul>
<li>Item 1</li>
<li>Item 2</li>
</ul>
```

## Defining Responsive Props with `getResponsiveAttributes` in React

This snippet defines the `Stack` component, demonstrating how to use `ResponsiveValue` and `getResponsiveAttributes` to create a responsive `padding` prop. It sets up types for `PaddingScale` and `Padding`, allowing the `padding` prop to accept either a direct value or a responsive object, which is then applied to the div via data attributes.

**Source:** [https://github.com/primer/react/blob/main/contributor-docs/authoring-css.md#_snippet_16](https://github.com/primer/react/blob/main/contributor-docs/authoring-css.md#_snippet_16)

```tsx

```
import type {ResponsiveValue} from '../hooks/useResponsiveValue'
import {getResponsiveAttributes} from '../internal/utils/getResponsiveAttributes'

// types
type PaddingScale = 'none' | 'condensed' | 'normal' | 'spacious'
type Padding = PaddingScale | ResponsiveValue<PaddingScale>

// prop
type StackProps = {
padding?: Padding
}

// component
export function Stack({padding = 'normal'}: StackProps) {
return <div {...getResponsiveAttributes('padding', padding)} />
}
```
